Next Steps:
>   Normalize the fitness values based on sequence length
>   Increase the number of segments in a set
>   Stick with YSK2 architecture
>   Think about a way to reward longer uninterrupted matches
>   Take a look at HMMs

>   Types of Amino Acids?
>   Reduced amino acid set
>   How many more characters can be added to SDAs?
>   Way of aligning IDPs (KMAD) - Steffen sent the paper
>   PAM and Blosum matricies (substitution matricies)
>   Serine Verianine and Therranine
>   Dehydrins don't want hydrophobic amino acids (getting away from water)

DISSERTATION:
>   Propose a committee meeting week of May 6th or 13th
>   Run through presentation on May 7th
>   Contact Zeny to schedule the meeting
>   Full presentation of the work and steps to move forward



increasing the size of the sets used in this work

this end, the next step will be to increa

Non-phi segment sequences.

Mixing phi and non-phi sets.

Is there some signal in the Phi-segment?

Different IDPs from the same organism will this pick up something from Phi

Take AA composition from these phi-segments (codon bias) and scrambling them.

Build an SDA for Phi and apply to non-phi from the same species.

Looking at which sequences contribute to the naive fitness the most -> indicates similarity...





























Arabidopsis




Ahalleri - 2
Alyrata - 3
Athaliana - 2

Do MSA on all 7
Grab most similar from each of the three
Slice out the Phi-segment from each of these three unaligned sequences
Grab the corresponding DNA sequence for each

Naive Match Fitness: count the number of characters matched in all
three sequences

Frequency Match Fitness: add the frequency of correct matches at each
index
Output:     A   B   C   D   E   F
Seq1:       A   A   C   E   E   F
Seq2:       A   B   D   D
            1   .5  .5  .5  1   1
            2.5

Correctness Match Fitness:
Seq1: 80%
Seq2: 70%
Fitness: 75%

Word Match Fitness:
SDA vs Seqs looking at words of length 2, 3, etc.

Edit-Distance Fitness:
SDA with gaps between the characters.

MSA of the seqs before running
MSA of the seq with the SDA output
